# AvalonBar-TrayTile
AvalonBar Tray Tile reworked to work on Windows 10

The basic functionality of displaying the icons in the tile sort-of works. There are a lot of issues I've found:

 - Only systray icons on the main taskbar are added to the tile (overflow is ignored)
 - Double-click for icons doesn't work at all
 - Right-click menu works for some icons
 - System icon right-click menus appear at random places on the screen
 - Lack of notifications support
 - When adding an icon that updates itself (ie task manager), the tray tile is spammed with all the individual icons
 - probably loads more I've not seen yet
